Tavern Keeper is a powerful multi-purpose discord bot written in JavaScript using the Discord.js library. Tavern Keeper provides the basic features of any good bot such as Server Moderation, Server Information, Image Manipulation and much more. Tavern Keeper also has a customisable prefix, but the default prefix is `>`
